# Sentinel---QA-Optimizer
Smart QA automation platform for test generation, performance profiling, security scanning, and maintainable code improvements.

# ProjectSentinel – QA Assessment for Developers


**Project Sentinel** is an intelligent AI-based development companion that transforms traditional code analysis into a unified platform for **testing, performance optimization, security auditing, and code quality enhancement** across entire codebases.

---

## 🧠 Platform Overview

Initially created to address common developer pain points such as broken tests after refactoring, Project Sentinel has evolved into a **comprehensive AI-powered code intelligence platform**.

It delivers **real-time, multi-layered analysis** across performance, security, testing, algorithm efficiency, and maintainability—supported by clear, interactive visual dashboards.

## 🎯 Challenges We Address

Modern software development often faces:

- ❌ Uncovered edge cases  
- ❌ Test failures after code modifications  
- ❌ Inefficient or slow code execution  
- ❌ Hidden security vulnerabilities  
- ❌ Poor visibility into runtime performance  

**Project Sentinel solves these challenges through a single, integrated solution.**
